# Days Calendar Project

This document explains how each requirement from the project rubric was verified. We used a combination of automated **Unit Tests** and **Manual Observation**.

## 📋 General Requirements (For Everyone)

### 1. Initial Load & Current Month

- **Requirement:** Open the calendar; it should show the current month.
- **How we tested:** Manual observation. Upon loading the page, we verified the title matches the current month and the grid matches the current calendar month.

### 2. October 2024 Verification

- **Requirement:** 5 rows x 7 columns, Oct 1 starts on Tuesday, Oct 8 is Ada Lovelace Day, Oct 25 is World Lemur Day.
- **How we tested:**
  - **Unit Tests:** In `common.test.mjs`, we verify the date calculations for Ada Lovelace and World Lemur Day 2024.
  - **Manual Observation:** Navigated to Oct 2024. Verified the grid dimensions and that Sunday/Monday are blank at the start of the first row.

### 3. October 2020 & May 2030 Verification

- **Requirement:** Oct 13 2020 (Ada Lovelace), Oct 30 2020 (Lemur Day), May 11 2030 (Binturong Day).
- **How we tested:**
  - **Unit Tests:** Included specific test cases in `common.test.mjs` for these dates.
  - **Manual Observation:** Used the "Jump to" feature to verify these dates visually in the UI.

### 4. Specific Month Padding/Grid Limits

- **Requirement:** Verify specific padding/start-end dates for 2024-12, 2025-02, 2025-05, and 2026-02.
- **How we tested:**
  - **Unit Tests:** We wrote tests to verify the start and end days for these specific months (e.g., Feb 1, 2026 is a Sunday).
  - **Manual Observation:** Visually checked these months to ensure no extra rows existed and padding was correct (e.g., Dec 2024 ends with 4 empty boxes).

### 5. Navigation & Jump-To

- **Requirement:** Infinite Prev/Next buttons and a usable Jump-to selector. No "NaN" or "undefined" in UI.
- **How we tested:**
  - **Manual Stress Test:** Clicked "Next" 24+ times to verify year transitions.
  - **Manual UI Check:** Navigated between various years (1900, 2024, 2100). Verified that the month dropdown and year input always stay in sync with the displayed month.

### 6. Dynamic Generation & No Hard-Coding

- **Requirement:** UI generated by DOM manipulation; works if days are added to JSON.
- **How we tested:**
  - **The "Pizza Test":** We manually added a fake holiday to `days.json`. We verified it appeared on the calendar without any changes to the JavaScript code.
  - **Code Review:** Verified `main.mjs` uses a loop to iterate through the fetched JSON data.

### 7. Accessibility

- **Requirement:** Score 100 in Lighthouse Accessibility.
- **How we tested:**
  - Used Chrome DevTools **Lighthouse** (Snapshot mode).
  - Fixed issues regarding form labels (`<label for="...">`) and touch target sizes until a **100 score** was consistently achieved.

### 8. Non-Trivial Unit Tests

- **Requirement:** At least one non-trivial unit test.
- **How we tested:**
  - **Unit Tests:** Located in `common.test.mjs`. These are non-trivial because they verify the "Smart Math" logic (e.g., calculating the "last Friday" of a month) and UTC correctness.

## 👥 Requirements for Groups (2+)

### 1. iCal Generation (`days.ics`)

- **Requirement:** Generate file via Node, 2020-2030 range, whole-day events, no recurring events.
- **How we tested:**
  - **Script Execution:** Ran `npm run generate-ical` and verified `days.ics` was created.
  - **File Inspection:** Opened the `.ics` file to confirm no `RRULE` tags were used and that `DTSTART;VALUE=DATE:` format was used for all-day events.
  - **Google Calendar Import:** Imported the file into a new Google Calendar. Verified that Ada Lovelace Day 2024 appears correctly on Oct 8th.

### 2. Shared Logic

- **Requirement:** Logic must be shared between web and iCal generator.
- **How we tested:**
  - **Code Review:** Verified that both `main.mjs` (Web) and `generate-ical.mjs` (Node) import `calculateDayDate` from the same source file (`common.mjs`).

## 🌟 Requirements for Groups (3+)

_(Note: Although we are a group of 2, we implemented these features for better user experience)._

### 1. Fetch Description & API Usage

- **Requirement:** Fetch description from URL in JSON; display on click.
- **How we tested:**
  - **Manual Observation:** Clicked "Ada Lovelace Day" on the live site. Verified that a popup (alert) appeared with the correct description text fetched from the URL.
  - **iCal Check:** Verified the `DESCRIPTION` field in the generated `.ics` file contains the fetched text.

### 🚀 Summary of Test Command

To run the automated test suite, use:

```bash
npm test
```

_(Which runs `node common.test.mjs` as defined in `package.json`)_.
